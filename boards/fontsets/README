HOWTO make fontsets.

Add a directory here to define your fontset.
The name of the fontset you wish to use then needs to be defined
in the po/mo-file for your languages.

fonts.xml: used to specify the fonts.

If you wish to create a fontset that's distributed with GCompris,
you have to add a file specifying authorship if applicable and its licence.
The licence for the font must be compatible with the GPL.
