			 GCompris MOTIVATION

Big Issue:
  Today Linux does not have a lot of useful educational tools for children.
  When they exist, they are hard to find and request the teacher/parent to
  manage a lot of independant small tools.


Big Goal:
  Build an educational game suite all accessible from a single user interface.
  GCompris provides a simple to use user interface that makes it easy to select
  appropriate activities.

How:
  GCompris is designed in a way that it is easy to add new activities to it.
  An activity is called with the root canvas of the main window, and then
  the activity is free to implement the game scheme it wants.
  The status bar is a common facility provided to the activity. There is a C
  and a Python API to let activities access the core feature of GCompris.

  To make GCompris a powerful tool for all its users, the teachers,
  the children but also the developers, GCompris implements a plugin system
  where each activity is an independant plugin.

  GCompris provides some tools to let teacher/educator to easily add
  activities to GCompris.
