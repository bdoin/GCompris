        <_manual>Looking at the rockwall, you can see a sparkle somewhere. Move the mouse cursor next to this sparkle and use the mousewheel to zoom in.
If you zoomed in at maximum, a gold nugget will appear at the position of the sparkle. Click on the gold nugget to collect it.

Having collected the nugget, use the mousewheel to zoom out again. If you zoomed out at maximum, another sparkle will appear, showing the next gold
nugget to collect. Collect enough nuggets to complete the level.

The lorry in the lower, right corner of the screen will tell you the number of already collected nuggets and the total number of nuggets to collect
in this level.

Have fun! :)</_manual>
